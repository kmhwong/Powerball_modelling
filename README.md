# Powerball_modelling

This is experimental for applying deep learning models to predict Powerball results based on its historial results.
Note that the current Powerball practice (e.g. the number of balls being drawn and the range of numbers being adopted) started from April 21, 2018, so only the data from that data is used.
At pure randomness, the result should be expectedly poor.
